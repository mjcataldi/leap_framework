# LEAP Governance Pass — Standard Operational Prompt

Run a LEAP strategic reconciliation pass using the current LEAP framework.

Use this prompt when the repo, docs, branch state, implementation reality, and public framework language may have drifted.

This is a governance pass. It is not an implementation prompt.

## Required behavior

You must:

1. identify the current LEAP version and governing docs
2. inspect README, changelog, glossary, templates, and prompt library docs
3. identify stale terminology, especially outdated framework expansion or tool-specific language where tool-agnostic language is intended
4. check whether new docs are discoverable from the README
5. check whether templates and operational prompts are aligned with current framework rules
6. check whether LEAP Prompt taxonomy is aligned and LHS is treated as a prompt format, not a lifecycle phase
7. check whether the Ideation Loop and question-loop rules are represented consistently
8. check whether source-of-truth, repo reality, stop conditions, and execution profile requirements are preserved
9. check whether risk taxonomy, destructive-change, sensitive-area, and implementation-gravity guidance are present where needed
10. classify any drift found
11. recommend document updates, but do not rewrite files unless explicitly asked

## Drift categories

Use these categories:

```text
Strategy drift — framework direction or audience changed
Documentation drift — docs disagree with each other
Implementation drift — code or prompt artifacts do not match methodology
Branch drift — active branches or PRs conflict
Prompt drift — prompts assume stale files, old decisions, missing agent/tool, missing model, or missing reasoning level
Terminology drift — old terms remain after framework language changed
Adoption drift — public onboarding docs do not match current framework behavior
```

## Required output

```text
